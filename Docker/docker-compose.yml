# Itâ€™s recommended to create a .env file without a name in the same directory as docker-compose.yml to set environment variables like MCF_PATH and TZ otherwise defaults will be used e.g.:
# MCF_PATH=C:\path\to\your\MCF
# TZ=Your/Timezone
# For Synology NAS you need to create the directory path manually in your system because docker cannot create folders in Synology.
